			    Version 1.5

decoders, the codec package also maintains a collection of phonetic encoding 
utilities. 

Compatibility

o Codec 1.5 fixes some accidental binary incompatibilities between
  1.4 and 1.3, and thus it is NOT binary compatible with Codec-1.4.

Changes in this version include:

  New Features:
