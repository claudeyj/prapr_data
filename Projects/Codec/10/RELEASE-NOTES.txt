			 Commons Codec Package
			    Version 1.5
			   Release Notes

http://commons.apache.org/codec/

The codec package contains simple encoder and decoders for various formats 
such as Base64 and Hexadecimal. In addition to these widely used encoders and 
decoders, the codec package also maintains a collection of phonetic encoding 
utilities. 

Compatibility
o Codec 1.5 is binary compatible with Codec 1.3 with the exception of 
  [CODEC-111]: org.apache.commons.codec.net.URLCodec.ESCAPE_CHAR isn't final but should be.
o Codec 1.5 fixes some accidental binary incompatibilities between
  1.4 and 1.3, and thus it is NOT binary compatible with 1.4.
o Codec 1.5 has a minimum requirement of JDK 1.4

Changes in this version include:

  New Features:

o [CODEC-XYZ] TBD

  Fixed bugs:

o [CODEC-89]  new Base64().encode() appends a CRLF, and chunks results into 76 character lines
o [CODEC-98]  Base64InputStream causes NullPointerException on some input.
o [CODEC-111] org.apache.commons.codec.net.URLCodec.ESCAPE_CHAR isn't final but should be.
o [CODEC-112] Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize) throws IAE for valid maxResultSize if isChunked is false

  Changes:

o [CODEC-XYZ] TBD

Have fun!
