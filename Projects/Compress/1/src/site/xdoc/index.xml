            <p>
                Commons Compress defines an API for working with tar, zip and bzip2 files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code in this component came from Avalon's Excalibur, but originally from Ant,
                as far as life in Apache goes. The tar package is originally Tim Endres' public
                domain package. The bzip2 package is based on the work done by Keiron Liddle.
                It has migrated via:<br/>
                Ant -&gt; Avalon-Excalibur -&gt; Commons-IO -&gt; Commons-Compress.
            </p>
