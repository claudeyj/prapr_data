      <section name="Reporting New Security Problems with Apache Commons Compress">
        <p>The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance
        in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks
        against its products.</p>

        <p>We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our
        private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in
        a public forum.</p>

        <p>Please note that the security mailing list should only be
        used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities and
        managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot
        accept regular bug reports or other queries at this
        address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to
        an undisclosed security problem in our source code will be
        ignored.</p>

        <p>If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed
        security vulnerability, please use the <a
        href="issue-tracking.html">bug reporting page</a>.</p>

        <p>Questions about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>if a vulnerability applies to your particular application</li>
          <li>obtaining further information on a published vulnerability</li>
          <li>availability of patches and/or new releases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>should be addressed to the users mailing list. Please see
        the <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing lists page</a> for
        details of how to subscribe.</p>

        <p>The private security mailing address is: <a
        href="mailto:security@apache.org">security@apache.org</a></p>

      <section name="Apache Commons Compress Security Vulnerabilities">
        <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in
        released versions of Apache Commons Compress. Each
        vulnerability is given a security impact rating by the
        development team - please note that this rating may vary from
        platform to platform. We also list the versions of Commons
        Compress the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not
        been verified list the version with a question mark.</p>

        <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you
        need to apply a source code patch, use the building
        instructions for the Commons Compress version that you are
        using.</p>

        <p>If you need help on building Commons Compress or other help
        on following the instructions to mitigate the known
        vulnerabilities listed here, please send your questions to the
        public <a href="mail-lists.html">Compress Users mailing
        list</a>.</p>

        <p>If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability
        or other unexpected behaviour that has security impact, or if
        the descriptions here are incomplete, please report them
        privately to the Apache Security Team. Thank you.</p>

        <subsection name="Fixed in Apache Commons Compress 1.4.1">
          <p><b>Low: Denial of Service</b> <a
          href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098">CVE-2012-2098</a></p>

          <p>The bzip2 compressing streams in Apache Commons Compress
          internally use sorting algorithms with unacceptable
          worst-case performance on very repetitive inputs.  A
          specially crafted input to Compress'
          <code>BZip2CompressorOutputStream</code> can be used to make
          the process spend a very long time while using up all
          available processing time effectively leading to a denial of
          service.</p>

          <p>This was fixed in revisions
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=1332540">1332540</a>,
