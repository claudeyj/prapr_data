This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelnotes
mv target/announcement/release-notes.vm RELEASE-NOTES.txt
then tweak the formatting if necessary and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

       Tar implementation does not support Pax headers
       Added support for reading pax headers.
       Note: does not support global pax headers

       Support "ustar" prefix field, which is used when file paths are longer
       than 100 characters.

      <action type="update" date="2010-04-19" issue="COMPRESS-105">
       Document that the name of an ZipArchiveEntry determines whether
       an entry is considered a directory or not.
       If you don't use the constructor with the File argument the entry's
        name must end in a "/" in order for the entry to be known as a directory.
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2010-03-19" issue="COMPRESS-103">
        ZipArchiveInputStream can optionally extract data that used
        the STORED compression method and a data descriptor.
        Doing so in a stream is not safe in general, so you have to
        explicitly enable the feature.  By default the stream will
        throw an exception if it encounters such an entry.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" date="2010-03-12" issue="COMPRESS-100">
        ZipArchiveInputStream will throw an exception if it detects an
        entry that uses a data descriptor for a STORED entry since it
        cannot reliably find the end of data for this "compression"
        method.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" date="2010-03-12" issue="COMPRESS-101">
        ZipArchiveInputStream should now properly read archives that
        use data descriptors but without the "unofficial" signature.
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2010-03-09" issue="COMPRESS-98">
        The ZIP classes will throw specialized exceptions if any
        attempt is made to read or write data that uses zip features
        not supported (yet).
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2010-03-08" issue="COMPRESS-99">
        ZipFile#getEntries returns entries in a predictable order -
        the order they appear inside the central directory.
        A new method getEntriesInPhysicalOrder returns entries in
        order of the entry data, i.e. the order ZipArchiveInputStream
        would see.
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2010-02-19">
        The Archive*Stream and ZipFile classes now have
        can(Read|Write)EntryData methods that can be used to check
        whether a given entry's data can be read/written.
        The method currently returns false for ZIP archives if an
        entry uses an unsupported compression method or encryption.
      </action>
      <action type="add" date="2010-02-19" issue="COMPRESS-89">
        The ZIP classes now detect encrypted entries.

        read properly.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" date="2010-02-18">
        ArchiveInputStream has a new method getBytesRead that should
        be preferred over getCount since the later may truncate the
        number of bytes read for big archives.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" date="2010-02-18" issue="COMPRESS-85">
        The cpio archives created by CpioArchiveOutputStream couldn't
        be read by many existing native implementations because the
        archives contained multiple entries with the same inode/device
        combinations and weren't padded to a blocksize of 512 bytes.

      <action type="fix" date="2010-02-16" issue="COMPRESS-73">
        ZipArchiveEntry, ZipFile and ZipArchiveInputStream are now
        more lenient when parsing extra fields.

        ZipArchiveEntry's equals method was broken for entries created

      <action type="add" date="2009-08-25">
        A new constructor of TarArchiveEntry can create entries with

        leading slashes in order to create relative path names.
