Release 1.2 - a bugfix release,
        
              The last release expected to be compatible with Java 1.4.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o COMPRESS-123:  ZipArchiveEntry has a new method getRawName that provides the
        original bytes that made up the name.  This may allow user
        code to detect the encoding. 
o COMPRESS-122:  TarArchiveEntry provides access to the flags that determine
        whether it is an archived symbolic link, pipe or other
        "uncommon" file system object. 

Fixed Bugs:
o COMPRESS-129:  ZipArchiveInputStream could fail with a "Truncated ZIP" error
        message for entries between 2 GByte and 4 GByte in size. 
o COMPRESS-145:  TarArchiveInputStream now detects sparse entries using the
        oldgnu format and properly reports it cannot extract their
        contents. 
o COMPRESS-130:  The Javadoc for ZipArchiveInputStream#skip now matches the
        implementation, the code has been made more defensive. 
o COMPRESS-140:  ArArchiveInputStream fails if entries contain only blanks for
        userId or groupId. Thanks to Trejkaz. 
o COMPRESS-139:  ZipFile may leak resources on some JDKs. 
o COMPRESS-125:  BZip2CompressorInputStream throws IOException if
        underlying stream returns available() == 0.
        Removed the check. 
o COMPRESS-127:  Calling close() on inputStream returned by
        CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream()
        does not close the underlying input stream. 
o COMPRESS-119:  TarArchiveOutputStream#finish now writes all buffered
        data to the stream 

Changes:
o ZipFile now implements finalize which closes the underlying
        file. 
o COMPRESS-117:  Certain tar files not recognised by ArchiveStreamFactory.
