<section name="Using Commons CSV">
  <p>Commons CSV reads and writes files in variations of the Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.</p>
  <p>To parse an Excel CSV file, write:</p>
  <source>Reader in = new FileReader(&quot;path/to/file.csv&quot;);
Iterable&lt;CSVRecord&gt; records = CSVFormat.EXCEL.parse(in);
for (CSVRecord record : records) {
  String lastName = record.get("Last Name");
  String firstName = record.get("First Name");
}</source>
  <p>Other formats are available, please consult the Javadoc for <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.html">CSVFormat</a> and
  <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVParser.html">CSVParser</a>.</p>
</section>

<section name="Getting the code">
  <p>There are currently no official downloads, and will not be until version 1.0 is released.</p>
  <p>The latest code can be checked out from our Subversion repository at <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/csv/trunk/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/csv/trunk/</a>. </p>
  <p>You can build the component using Apache Maven. For example: mvn clean package.</p>
</section>
<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Getting Involved">
  <p>
    The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons developer mailing list</a> is the main channel of communication for contributors. Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components, so prefix your email by [csv]. </p>
  <p>You can also visit the #apache-commons IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or peruse <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a>. Specific links of interest for JIRA are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ideas looking for code: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CSV%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Patch%20Needed%22">Patch Needed</a></li>
    <li>Issues with patches, looking for reviews: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CSV%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20Review">Review Patch</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alternatively you can go through the <em>Needs Work</em> tags in the <a href="taglist.html">TagList report</a>.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to offer up pull requests via GitHub rather than applying patches to JIRA, we have a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-csv/">GitHub mirror</a>. </p>

<section name="Support">
  <p>
    The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons mailing lists</a> act as the main support forum.
    The user list is suitable for most library usage queries.
    The dev list is intended for the development discussion.
    Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components,
    so prefix your email by [csv].
  </p>
  <p>
    Bug reports and enhancements are also welcomed via the <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a> issue tracker.
    Please read the instructions carefully.

<section name="About Commons CSV">
  <p>Commons CSV was started to unify a common and simple interface for reading and writing CSV files under an ASL license. It has been bootstrapped by a code donation from Netcetera in Switzerland. There are three pre-existing BSD compatible CSV parsers which this component will hopefully make redundant (authors willing): </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/csv/">Skife CSV</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/">Open CSV</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.osjava.org/genjava/multiproject/gj-csv/">Genjava CSV</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to the code from Netcetera (org.apache.commons.csv), Martin van den Bemt has added an additional writer API. </p>
  <p>Other CSV implementations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://supercsv.sourceforge.net/">Super CSV</a></li>
  </ul>
