      <p>
        The examples section aims to show how a variety of applications and 
        tools could be modelled using CLI2.  We make no claim that these tools 
        use CLI2 in their implementation but simply use their interfaces to 
        demonstrate commonly needed features.  Some examples will make 
        simplifications to keep the documentation consise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many aspects of the API are touched upon but few are described in 
        great detail.  If more information is required then the reader is 
        encouraged to review the API documentation and look at the unit tests 
        for inspiration.  Failing that, further advice and discussion can be 
        found on the <code>commons-user@jakarta.apache.org</code> mailing list.
