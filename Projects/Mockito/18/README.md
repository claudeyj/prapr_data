## Versioning

Mockito has an automated release system, which imposed some change how the version numbers. While this is similar to semver, there's some differences. Let's look at at both versions `1.10.19` and `2.0.5-beta` they follow this scheme :

```
major.minor.build-tag
```

| number | meaning                                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| major  | major version, with most probably incompatible change in API and behavior  |
| minor  | minor version, important enough change to bump this number                 |
| build  | a released build number incremented automatically a pull request is merged |
| tag    | will probably be `-beta` or just nothing                                   |
