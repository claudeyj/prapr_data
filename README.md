## This repository includes all [Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) bugs and all of the bugs can be compiled by Maven (with available pom.xml) in each bug. Please use Java 7 to run all projects and copy the dependencies in folder "Repository" to your local repository .m2 folder.

## But some bugs have issues that the failed tests by running "mvn test" are not same as original failed tests from Defects4J. Please kindly report the issues if you can resolve such problems.
